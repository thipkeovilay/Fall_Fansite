      <h1>Budget Friendly Fall Activities</h1>
      <h3>By Ramsey Solutions</h3>
      <p>
        So, this year has meant a lot of canceled plans, but fun doesn’t have to
        be canceled. In fact, with the cooler temperatures of autumn finally
        here, it’s the perfect time for outdoor fun—and you don’t even have to
        bust your budget to join in!
      </p>
      <p>
        To give you some ideas, we’ve created an EveryDollar fall bucket list,
        perfect for this year and all its challenges. How many of these autumn
        activities can you and your family cross off before winter?
      </p>
      <h3 id="twenty">
        Now, let's get to the list of 20 things that will give you and your
        family a memorable time!
      </h3>
      <p>
        1. Go on a nature hike. Make a game out of your family hike with a
        nature bingo sheet. Include things like acorns, orange leaves and fuzzy
        squirrels. You can find one online or whip up your own. Whoever gets
        bingo first wins!
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Have a picnic. The weather is perfect. It’s the most wonderful time
        of year for everyone who likes not-too-hot and not-too-cold. Why not
        enjoy it with a nice picnic lunch at a local park? You can make it even
        better if you pack a couple of autumn treats, like pumpkin lattes, bread
        and pies. Super budget-friendly. Super fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Go pick pumpkins. Speaking of all things pumpkin, did you know
        they’re technically berries? Yeah. Don’t worry, you don’t need that
        trivia fact to get into the pumpkin patch. Just make sure you budget for
        all the cute gourds you want to bring home with you!
      </p>
      <p>
        4. Carve jack-o’-lanterns. Once you’ve visited the pumpkin patch, make a
        family date of picking out patterns and (carefully) carving them into
        your pumpkins. Don’t forget to budget for the candles! And if the kids
        are too young, paint those pumpkins instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Visit an apple orchard. This is an autumn family classic. If you live
        near an apple orchard, make a day of it. Some places sell you bushels of
        apples, while others even let you pick your own. Either way, you'll
        enjoy two things that are good for you: fresh air and fresh fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Make your own local fun. So, yeah—lots of the fun local stuff you’re
        used to isn’t happening this year. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make
        your own (budget-friendly) fall fun! Organize a street parade with the
        neighbors. Have a small group of friends bring their own food and
        camping chairs and enjoy a backyard get-together.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Create an outdoor obstacle course. The weather outside is
        excellent—perfect for an outdoor obstacle course. Take turns creating
        and competing. Use stuff from around the house to set up things to jump
        over, run around, and knock through. All you need is creativity, the
        stopwatch on your phone, and maybe an ice pack if things get really
        hard-core.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. Tailgate from home. Are you ready for some football? Even though game
        days won't feel quite the same this year, you can still create a
        tailgate vibe inside or out with the right snacks and a few friends over
        to cheer on your favorite team from your couch!
      </p>
      <p>
        9. Make apple cobbler. Nothing says fall like the smell of fresh apple
        cobbler in the oven. It’ll smell even better if you use the apples you
        bought (or picked) on your trip to the apple orchard.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. Make popcorn on the stove. Sure, you can make popcorn on the stove
        no matter what month it is. But there’s something extra special about
        this cozy tradition in the fall. And it tastes good too!
      </p>
      <p>
        11. Roast pumpkin seeds. Make the most of your pumpkins by scooping out
        the seeds when you’re carving jack-o’-lanterns. Toss them on a baking
        sheet with a drizzle of oil and salt. Then bake at 350 degrees F for 45
        minutes (stirring occasionally, and you’ll have a delicious snack!
      </p>
      <p>
        12. Watch a fave fall movie. Your tv streaming service is packed with
        seasonal films right now. Share an old favorite with the family. Or let
        everyone pick one to watch and make a couple evenings out of it. Throw
        some of those roasted pumpkin seeds and a cup of candy corn into your
        stovetop popcorn, and you’ve got an awesome fall movie snack.
      </p>
      <p>
        13. Learn about money together. Of course, getting money smart is always
        in season, but what if you make use of all this extra time together to
        do something really meaningful for everyone’s future? Start by watching
        Smart Money Smart Kids, one of the many courses inside Ramsey+. Learn
        how to teach your kids about money. Then use all this new practical
        knowledge and go teach them!
      </p>
      <p>
        14. Roast marshmallows. There’s just something about this time of year
        that makes roasting marshmallows an absolute must. Bonus points if you
        make s’mores.
      </p>
      <p>
        15. Drink hot chocolate. Autumn isn’t complete unless you enjoy a few
        mugs of hot chocolate on crisp fall nights. Or if you aren’t a fan of
        chocolate, swap it out for a hearty cup of spiced apple cider. Yum!
      </p>
      <p>
        16. Go for a Sunday drive. Leisurely Sunday drives are always in style,
        but they’re even better in the fall. Grab a blanket, roll down the
        windows, and hit the road to admire all the leaves changing colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        17. Camp out in your backyard. You don’t have to go far to have some
        camping fun. Pop up a tent in your own backyard. Download a free
        stargazing app for some added free fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        18. Enjoy some spooky science. Check out sciencefun.org for all sorts of
        fun home experiments—including one that makes your jack-o-lantern foam
        at the mouth!
      </p>
      <p>
        19. Take up bird-watching. Listen, bird-watching isn’t just for
        80-year-olds. Search online together for birds local to your area, make
        a list, and go see which ones you can find in the neighborhood, in the
        park, or on a hike. All you need to budget for is a bucket hat (not
        really) and binoculars for this educational fall activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        20. Jump into a pile of leaves. Okay—this one involves work. But hey,
        you’ll burn some calories as you go. Make a pile, jump in. Repeat until
        everyone tuckers out.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        This year is like none other. But look at all these examples of awesome
        ways you can enjoy time together—on a budget, no less! Because let’s get
        real: One thing we’ve (hopefully) learned this year is the value of time
        together. And you don’t have to spend a lot to make a lot of memories.
