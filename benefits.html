    <h1>8 Surprising Effects Changing Leaves Can Have On Your Body</h1>
      <h3 id="author">By Rebecca Endicott</h3>
        <p>When you’re a kid, there’s no question which season is the best; how could you possibly beat summer? But as you get older and your views get a little bit more nuanced (and you start paying the electric bill for that A/C unit,) summer starts to lose its luster.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, fall, which once meant back to school and flu shots, becomes more and more appealing! All that fresh crisp air; all those beautiful colors; all the pumpkin-spice coffee you could possible drink! And on top of all of the simple pleasures of autumn, it could also be doing incredible things for your health!</p>
        <p>Sure, we might be slowly but surely settling into hibernation mode as the days get shorter, but during the fall, the conditions are just right for our mental and physical health to be better than ever. Below is a list of 8 things - and then more - that are beneficial for you and your body during Fall Season</p>
      <h3>Autumn Health Perk #1: Your Sleep Will Grow Deeper</h3>
        <p>Sleep is also a health advantage during fall. During fall our bodies get more rest, sunrise comes later and sunset comes earlier every single day. Although we only gain one hour of sleep, it does wonders for a person’s overall health. The dip in available sunlight triggers different adjustments in our bodies’ circadian rhythms, which will reset to make you sleepy earlier. Sleeping allows our bodies to recharge both physically and mentally.</p> 
        <p>Research has revealed that good quality sleep is linked to the reduction of heart disease and obesity. Studies have also shown that it is often easier for our bodies to adjust to standard time than to daylight savings time. So take advantage of what could be your body's natural tendency to get some rest. It’s also been proven that lower temperatures help us sleep better, so just crack your window on a cool fall night for the best sleep ever.</p>
      <h3>Autumn Health Perk #2: Fall Colors Promote Mental Health</h3>
        <p>When you’re feeling “down,” there’s no faster way to pick up your mood than to step outside. Not only does a hit of Vitamin D do incredible things for our serotonin levels, but there’s something innately soothing about being in the fresh air and looking at nature. In autumn, when the landscape is especially beautiful and colorful, the sight of bright leaves will dramatically and immediately boost your happiness and mental health.
      <h3>Autumn Health Perk #3: Seasonal Spices Improve Overall Wellness</h3>
        <p>You can’t have autumn comfort food without plenty of ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Fortunately, all three of these spices are delicious, and they improve your whole body health. Nutmeg has germ-killing properties, ginger improves the circulation, and cinnamon is linked to lower inflammation levels!</p>
      <h3>Autumn Health Perk #4: Your Love Life Ramps Up</h3>
        <p>They say that spring is the season for falling in love, but fall might be the season for making love. Not only do you find yourself snuggled up under the blankets an awful lot, but the the body’s testosterone levels reach their peak in the autumn. Higher testosterone levels are linked to increased sex drive in men and women, so don’t be surprised if your libido kicks up a notch this fall.</p>
      <h3>Autumn Health Perk #5: Say Goodbye To Brain Fog</h3>
        <p>“Brain fog” is a general term for malaise and fuzzy-headed feelings that affects all of us from time to time. In the summer, it’s easy to feel brain-fogged from the heat, but the crisp clear air of fall does wonders for clearing the cobwebs. It might be a bit of placebo effect, but lots of people find that bracing feeling of cold fall air helps break up the fog and get their brains going again!<p>
      <h3>Autumn Health Perk #6: You’ll Get Out More</h3>
        <p>Fall makes for the perfect time to get outdoors and increase the physical activity our bodies need. With cooler temperatures, the risk of heat-related health issues are reduced. Activities include walking, biking, hiking, horseback riding and raking leaves. These outdoor activities offer both a direct health benefit and a great emotional boost that comes from being in the midst of the beautiful colors this season produces.</p>
        <p>Fall is considered to be the season of change. Make this a fall of positive transitions and great memories while maintaining your health. We normally associate getting outside with the summer, but just think — how many summer days do you spend in the A/C, trying to avoid the stifling heat? In the autumn, you might not be hitting the beach, but you’re much more likely to go hiking or walking, play a round of golf, or engage in a game of touch-football with friends. All of that built-in exercise is more appealing because of the lovely weather, and it can improve your metabolism and your overall health.</p>
      <h3>Autumn Health Perk #7: It Brings Us Together</h3>
        <p>On a cold night, with the frost just gathering on the glass, is there anything better than snuggling up under a blanket with a loved on and watching a movie? Whether you’re cozying up to your partner, your kids, your pets — or some combination of the three — there’s nothing more comforting than a fall night in. Plus, all of that physical contact boosts our oxytocin levels, and makes us bond more closely with the people we’re hibernating with!</p>
      <h3>Autumn Health Perk #8: There’s Lots To Look Forward To</h3>
        <p>We all love Thanksgiving, Halloween, and shopping for Christmas presents in the fall, but there’s one thing we love even more: anticipating all of those activities. It’s true that humans derive more pleasure from anticipating a fun activity than they do from actually doing it. Fall is great for this because you have so much to plan and look forward to, which makes us happy and boosts our serotonin levels for the most contented season of them all!</p>
