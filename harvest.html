      <h1>Vegetables For Fall Harvest</h1>
      <h3>By Steve Albert</h3>
      <p>
        Leafy greens, root vegetables, and members of the cabbage family are
        good fall harvest crops. These crops can be planted in mid- to
        late-summer for fall harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fall harvest crops are generally cool-weather crops, the same ones
        commonly planted in late winter or early spring for late spring or early
        summer harvest. Where autumn weather tends to be warm, some
        fast-maturing warm-weather crops such as snap beans, summer squash, and
        even quick-maturing tomatoes also can be planted in late summer for fall
        harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leaf lettuce, spinach, mustard, Oriental greens, arugula, cress, sorrel,
        and kale make good fall crops. Beets, carrots, radishes, and turnips are
        also good fall harvest crops. All of these crops can be direct sown in
        the garden in mid- to late-summer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Summer cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Florence
        fennel, endive, escarole, and collard greens are crops for fall harvest
        that are best started indoors and later transplanted out into the
        garden. Start these crops indoors in early summer for mid- to
        late-summer transplanting into the garden. (These crops can also be
        purchased as starts from a local nursery.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Cool-weather crops sown in summer for fall harvest often perform better
        than when planted in spring. In mid- to late-summer, garden soil is
        already warm–not warming as in spring–and seeds germinate more readily.
        As well, transplants get a faster start in the warm season than in the
        colder part of the year. Cool-weather crops prefer to mature in cool
        weather; cool-weather crops planted in spring often come to maturity as
        the weather is warming, not cooling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cooling and cold weather enhances the flavor of many crops coming to
        harvest in autumn as plant metabolisms change with cooler temperatures.
        Sugars accumulate in plant tissues of cool-weather crops as temperatures
        decline and crops become sweeter flavored. Leafy crops such as lettuce
        are sweeter tasting in cool weather. Brussels sprouts, kale, and
        parsnips are noticeably more flavorful when exposed to cooler
        temperatures and even frost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Planting date. To calculate the planting dates for fall harvest crops,
        determine the first average frost date in your area; count back the
        number of days to maturity for each crop you plan to sow or transplant;
        add an extra week or two to the maturity time allowing for cooler
        temperatures and shorter days which slow plant growth. For example, sow
        broccoli three months before the first expected hard fall frost.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Northern Hemisphere, gardeners in zone 5 and north can plant
        cool-weather crops for fall harvest in early July, zone 6 in late July,
        and zone 7 in August. In zone 8 and south, cool-weather crops for fall
        harvest can be planted in mid- to late-August and September.
      </p>
      <p>
        An added advantage to mid- to late-summer planting is the decline in
        weed growth and a decline in insect pest populations with cooling
        temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Planting. Direct sow seeds in summer in the cooler part of the day when
        water will not quickly evaporate. Seeds and transplants should be
        watered thoroughly after planting; seedlings should be protected from
        harsh summer sun by shade cloth until average daytime temperatures begin
        to cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seedlings started indoors should be gradually exposed to outdoor
        conditions–hardened off–just as seedlings are hardened off in spring.
        Set starts out for a few hours each day, protected by shade, until they
        become accustomed to outdoor conditions in a week or so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plant crops for fall harvest in blocks instead of rows. Crops planted in
        blocks are easier to keep watered and as plants mature their leaves will
        shade the soil and slow evaporation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harvest. Keep a calendar or notebook with planting dates and expected
        harvest dates to ensure you harvest your crops at their peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        When frost is expected, be prepared to lift crops from the garden before
        they are damaged or place frost protection–such as frost blankets or
        plastic tunnels–over crops before a freeze occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carrots, leeks, parsnips, and turnips can be left in the late autumn and
        winter garden until needed; these crops should be protected by a one- to
        two-foot layer of mulch when freezing weather arrives. These crops
        should be harvested before the soil freezes solid.
