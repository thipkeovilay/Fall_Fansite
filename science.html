      <h1>The Process of Leaf Color Change</h1>
      <p>
        Leaves change color during the autumn because the amounts of pigments
        change as the leaves prepare to fall from the trees. All leaves
        gradually lose chlorophyll during the growing season, and this loss
        accelerates before leaf fall. Under optimal conditions this process of
        chlorophyll loss is very orderly and allows the plants to resorb much of
        the nitrogen in the structure of the pigment molecule. Carotenoid
        pigments are also lost from the plastids during aging, but some of them
        are retained in the plastids after the chlorophyll is removed; this
        produces autumn leaves with yellow colors. In unusual cases, sometimes
        in winterberry holly, a fair amount of chlorophyll is left in the leaves
        when they fall. Such leaves are a pale green in color, or perhaps
        yellow-green from the mixture of chlorophyll and carotenoids.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most interesting are leaves that turn red, because this color is the
        result of the active synthesis of anthocyanin pigments just before the
        leaves fall from the trees. This is the most common color of autumn
        leaves; about 70 % of shrubs and trees at the Harvard Forest produce
        anthocyanins during the senescence of the leaves. In these leaves, the
        actual shades of red are the consequences of the amounts of anthocyanin,
        the retention of carotenoids (or even a little chlorophyll). Anthocyanin
        and chlorophyll produce brownish colors. Anthocyanins and carotenoids
        produce orange hues. In some plants the color production is quite
        uniform, as in hobblebush or blueberry. In other plants, leaves vary
        between individuals (as sugar maples) or even dramatically within an
        individual (as red maples), or even within a single leaf (red maples).
